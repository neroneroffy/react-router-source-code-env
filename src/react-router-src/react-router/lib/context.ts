 * A Navigator is a "location changer"; it's how you get to different locations.

 * Every history instance conforms to the Navigator interface, but the
 * distinction is useful primarily when it comes to the low-level <Router> API
 * where both the location and a navigator must be provided separately in order
 * to avoid "tearing" that may occur in a suspense-enabled app if the action
 * and/or location were to be read directly from the history instance.
